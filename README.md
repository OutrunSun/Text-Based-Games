# Text-Based-Games
This is a series of projects to demonstrate decent knowledge of C# 

## Minesweeper
Extremely basic - there is currently no checker for if you have one

## Hangman
Has both singleplayer and multiplayer capacity - not much verification

## Noughts and Crosses
Extremely rudimentary 'AI' Programming - you can easily exploit the bot. Still in the works
